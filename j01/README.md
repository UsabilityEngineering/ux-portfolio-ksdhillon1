# Checking my grades on the Blackboard App
By Karandeep Dhillon, Date: 09/24/2022

At my university (CSU Chico), we use a service called Blackboard that is the main hub for students and professor to communicate and complete tasks. Professors can send announcements, post assignments, post grades, and do a variety of other things to supplement the learning in class. Students can view assignemtns, submit assignments, check important announcements, and check their grades. Blackboard is primarily accessed through a web browser, but there is also a mobile app. I have the mobile app on my phone so I can be notified of announcements and grade changes immediately. 

I am someone who is always eager to know my grade on all my assingments espically quizzes and tests so when I went to check my grades on the Blackboard mobile app, I noticed they had made a lot of new changes.
